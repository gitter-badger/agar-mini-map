## Share your vision to other players

With the minimap server, you can:
* Share the vision
* Mark cells which are in the same party (minimap server)

Minimap server allows you share your vision to others who already connected to the minimap server. The minimap server merges players' vision and send back the bigger vision to you.

The minimap server will take the first player's agar.io server address as the condition. Other players who want to connect to the minimap server will be verified whether the agar.io server address matches. Connection  The connection will succeed if the address matched, otherwise fails.
